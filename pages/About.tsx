              <h3 className="text-xl py-2">
                Hi, my name is Vegas Cruz, and I am 24 years young. I am from Sparta, WI! If you don't know where that is, it's near La Crosse. Currently, 
              I live in Milwaukee with my beautiful girlfriend, Amanda Yenter. 
              </h3>
              <h2 className="text-3xl py-2 text-teal-600 font-medium dark:text-teal-400">Interests</h2>
              <h3 className="text-xl py-2">
                My favorite hobby/passion is Volleyball. I love sand doubles, and grass triples... someday, 
                I'd like to live in California and play professionally. I also love to workout, my goal someday is a 40" vertical. Lately, I've rekindled my love for gaming. Love Call of Duty, 
                fighting games Mortal Kombat, and I also love RPG's like God of War and Dark Souls. I also love to watch TV, especially anime. Animes like Naruto, Dragonball, 
                Haikyuu, Bleach, and One Piece. 
              </h3>
              <h2 className="text-3xl py-2 text-teal-600 font-medium dark:text-teal-400">Goals</h2>
              <h3 className="text-xl py-2">
                My second goal someday is to be able to travel more... being a part time worker/student, I don't have the ability but that's a goal.
                I am currently in search for a Full-Stack or Web Developer job. I love front end, but am growing to understand/like backend more. 
                I fell in love with programming in High School where I took two programming classes. We learned C++ through Visual Studio. 
                We mostly worked on the command line, but I grew to love it the day I programmed a computer to say "Hello World". 
              </h3>
              <h2 className="text-3xl py-2 text-teal-600 font-medium dark:text-teal-400">Personality</h2>
              <h3 className="text-xl py-2">
                Let me tell you about my personality a bit. 
                I have the work ethic of a horse, except when it comes to doing dishes. I'm fun, and have a very bubbly personality. I'm kind and I treat people with respect... 
                my girlfriend says I'm too much of a people pleaser, 
                but it's how I grew up.
